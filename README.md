## Introduction
*Asservissement* is an application and a library to study [transfer function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function), both in open-loop and closed-loop, by plotting various diagrams:
- time response, with diverse inputs (impulse, step, ramp, …);
- frequency response (Bode, Black – Nichols, Nyquist, …).

Several indicators (initial tangent, response time, stability margins, …) can also be displayed.

It is mainly intendend to be used for teachers and students in a [Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles (CPGE)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles).
